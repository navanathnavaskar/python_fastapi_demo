### What Is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard type hints. It has the following key features:

Fast to run: It offers very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and pydantic.
Fast to code: It allows for significant increases in development speed.
Reduced number of bugs: It reduces the possibility for human-induced errors.
Intuitive: It offers great editor support, with completion everywhere and less time debugging.
Straightforward: It’s designed to be uncomplicated to use and learn, so you can spend less time reading documentation.
Short: It minimizes code duplication.
Robust: It provides production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
Standards-based: It’s based on the open standards for APIs, OpenAPI and JSON Schema.
